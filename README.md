# Apex YoloV5 Aimbot

This is a small project for my final report. They told me to create a project related to AI and I did.  

Turned out that I got 47 out of 100. Lol

## Usage
1. install requirements  
   `pip install -r requirements`
2. run main.py  
   `python main.py`

You can change the extension from .py to .pyw and there will be no console output.  
First load takes some time, be patient.

## Configuration
- ONE_DEGREE_MOVEPX_X  
Test how many pixels you need to rotate the cursor in a circle. 

- ONE_DEGREE_MOVEPX_Y  
Test how many pixels you need to move the cursor from bottom to top. (half sphere)

- FPS  
How many frames does the camera takes in a second

- FOV  
Just fov in game 

## Development

You can do any contributions, I am willing to see improvements.   
If you want to use my weight remember to make a citation.

## Tips

Go to firing range and test it out with moving dummies, try your best to adjust those parameters while making the best accuracy.
